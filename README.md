## 💡 Why the PHP Dev Server?

We use the built-in PHP development server (`-S`) because it is **portable** and requires **zero configuration**. It allows developers to get the project running instantly without setting up complex web servers like Apache or Nginx, making it perfect for rapid prototyping and local testing.
